# Web3 Whitepaper / Litepaper

## Scope

- **Whitepaper**: canonical technical and economic specification -- audit-oriented, assumption-explicit, falsifiable.
- **Litepaper**: concise orientation (problem, solution, differentiation) that **indexes into** the whitepaper and never contradicts it.

If only one document ships, name it honestly. A litepaper with extra adjectives is not a whitepaper.

## Pre-draft checklist

Before writing a single section, lock these with stakeholders:

1. **Document type** -- whitepaper or litepaper (scope, depth, audience).
2. **Audience** -- developers / researchers / partners / community / press. Drives reading level and detail.
3. **Jurisdiction and compliance** -- required disclaimers, restricted regions, regulatory posture. For any token, staking, governance, or fee language, run all public prose through the **legalizer** skill or external counsel. This skill does not replace legal review.
4. **Terminology glossary** -- define project-specific terms once; use consistently throughout.
5. **Citation log** -- table of `claim | source | verified-by | date`. Maintain alongside the draft; do not bolt on after.
6. **Modular structure** -- each section must be independently updatable (metrics refresh, roadmap shift) without rewriting adjacent sections.

## Whitepaper sections (minimum required)

Produce sections in this order. Every section heading is mandatory; mark any section "N/A" with a one-line justification if it truly does not apply.

### 1. Executive summary

One page. State: what the protocol does, for whom, core differentiator, and current stage (testnet / mainnet / audit status). No claims that the body does not substantiate.

### 2. Problem and scope

- Concrete problem statement with evidence (market data, user pain, existing-solution gaps).
- Explicit **non-goals** -- what this protocol does not attempt.
- Avoid generic "blockchain will fix everything" framing.

### 3. System overview

- Component diagram: on-chain contracts, off-chain services, external dependencies (oracles, bridges, data availability).
- Trust boundaries: what each actor must trust, and what is trustless.
- One-paragraph "how a transaction flows" narrative covering the happy path.

### 4. Architecture

- Data model and state transitions.
- Consensus or participation model (PoS, PoA, rollup, DA committee, etc.) with finality guarantees.
- Upgrade path: immutable vs upgradeable contracts, proxy patterns, migration strategy.
- External integrations: name each oracle, bridge, or L1/L2 dependency and its trust model.

### 5. Threat model and security

- **Adversary classes**: rational economic, Byzantine, colluding subsets, governance attackers.
- **Assumptions**: honest majority threshold, liveness bound, censorship resistance level, key management model.
- **Attack surface**: smart contract bugs, oracle manipulation, bridge exploits, MEV, front-running.
- **Mitigations**: audits (name firms, link reports), formal verification scope, bug bounty, incident response.
- If no audit exists yet, state timeline and do not imply auditedness.

### 6. Token and economics (only if a token exists)

**All prose in this section must pass legalizer before publication.**

- **Mechanism**: issuance schedule, supply cap or inflation model, sinks (burns, fees, lockups), sources (minting, distributions).
- **Utility**: what the token *does* in the protocol (gas, staking weight, governance vote, access). Describe function, not financial outcome.
- **Staking / slashing** (if applicable): conditions, cooldown, slashing severity, validator requirements as operational facts.
- **Fee model**: who pays, where fees go (treasury, burn, validators), parameter governance.
- **Distribution**: allocation table (team, treasury, community, ecosystem) with vesting and cliff. Factual, not pitched.

Do **not** include: price projections, ROI estimates, yield promises, "value accrual" narratives, pie charts without verified numbers.

### 7. Governance and upgrades

- Decision-making: on-chain vote, multisig, time-locked admin, emergency keys.
- Thresholds: quorum, supermajority, veto, proposal lifecycle.
- Centralization disclosure: who holds admin keys today, and the decentralization roadmap (if any).
- Readers assume centralization unless you map it explicitly.

### 8. Roadmap

- Phased, with **dependencies** between phases (not just dates).
- Current phase clearly marked.
- Honest about what is shipped vs planned vs speculative.
- Avoid marketing-only timelines with no engineering backing.

### 9. Risks and limitations

- Technical risks: unaudited code, novel cryptography, dependency on unproven L1/L2.
- Operational risks: key-person dependency, geographic concentration, single-cloud hosting.
- Regulatory risks: jurisdictional exposure, pending guidance, classification uncertainty.
- Dependency risks: oracle liveness, bridge security, upstream protocol changes.
- Open problems the team has not solved yet.

### 10. References, audits, and reproducibility

- Every non-obvious claim cites a source (paper, audit report, on-chain data, benchmark).
- Performance numbers include: hardware, software versions, network conditions, date measured.
- Link to repos, deployed contracts (with verified source), and testnets.
- Audit reports linked with scope summary and date.

## Litepaper sections (minimum required)

| Section | Guidance |
|---------|----------|
| Executive summary | Same rules as whitepaper; one page max. |
| Problem and solution | Problem evidence + solution sketch; no deeper than necessary for orientation. |
| How it works | One diagram, one narrative paragraph. Glossary for non-obvious terms. |
| Token overview (if any) | Utility description only; distribution table if numbers are final and legal-cleared. **Legalizer pass required.** |
| Links and pointers | Full whitepaper, audits, GitHub, testnet/mainnet, community channels. |
| Disclaimers | Same legal/disclaimer block as the whitepaper (approved, version-controlled). |

A litepaper should be readable in under 10 minutes. If it exceeds 8 pages, it is probably a whitepaper draft that needs either promotion or trimming.

## Writing standards

- **Verifiable over rhetorical** -- every claim should be traceable to code, data, or a cited source.
- **Precise definitions** -- terms like "decentralized," "trustless," "scalable," "secure" must carry the project's specific meaning, not slogans.
- **No superlatives** -- drop "revolutionary," "game-changing," "first-ever" unless independently verified.
- **Consistent terminology** -- pick one term per concept and use it everywhere (glossary enforces this).
- **Diagrams over prose** for architecture and flows; label trust boundaries.
- **Third-person factual tone** per legalizer tone standard: describe mechanics, not outcomes.

## Draft workflow

```
Phase 1: Outline
  - Lock section list with product owner.
  - Confirm glossary and citation log template.
  - If token section exists, flag for legalizer review.
  Gate: outline approved by product + legal stakeholder.

Phase 2: First draft
  - Write body with inline citation placeholders [CIT-nn].
  - Fill citation log entries as claims are written.
  - Diagrams: architecture, data flow, governance topology.
  Gate: all [CIT-nn] resolved; no placeholder text remains.

Phase 3: Technical review
  - Engineering SME reviews: architecture, threat model, performance claims.
  - Security SME reviews: threat model completeness, audit references.
  Gate: SME sign-off or logged objections addressed.

Phase 4: Compliance review
  - Run token/governance/staking sections through legalizer.
  - Legal/compliance reviews disclaimers, jurisdiction list, restricted-region language.
  Gate: zero legalizer hard-blocks remain; soft-flags resolved or justified.

Phase 5: Final review
  - Full read for internal consistency (no section contradicts another).
  - Verify all links resolve (repos, audits, contracts, testnets).
  - Confirm version number and date on the document.
  Gate: version-stamped, ready for publication.
```

## Self-check before publication

Run through this list after the final draft. Every item must pass.

- [ ] Executive summary makes no claim the body does not substantiate.
- [ ] Non-goals are stated explicitly.
- [ ] Trust boundaries are diagrammed, not hand-waved.
- [ ] Threat model names adversary classes and assumptions.
- [ ] Token section describes function, not financial outcome.
- [ ] No legalizer hard-block terms remain anywhere in the document.
- [ ] Governance section discloses current centralization honestly.
- [ ] Roadmap has dependencies, not just dates.
- [ ] Risks section exists and is non-trivial (not a single disclaimer paragraph).
- [ ] Every performance number has methodology and environment context.
- [ ] Citation log is complete: every non-obvious claim has a source.
- [ ] All links (repos, audits, contracts, testnets) resolve.
- [ ] Glossary covers every project-specific or potentially ambiguous term.
- [ ] Litepaper (if separate) does not contradict or exceed the whitepaper.
- [ ] Legal disclaimers use version-controlled approved language.

## Derivative assets

If landing pages, emails, or social posts accompany the paper, they must quote **approved whitepaper language only**. No new claims, no new promises. Derivative content that drifts from the source document is a compliance and credibility risk.

## Do not

- Frame tokens as investments or guaranteed returns (legalizer governs this).
- Publish performance claims without reproducible methodology.
- Ship a litepaper that contains information absent from the whitepaper.
- Use "decentralized" without specifying what is decentralized and what is not.
- Let marketing copy introduce promises the technical document does not support.
